# Architectural Prompt Generator

## About the Project

The Architectural Prompt Generator is a creative tool developed to inspire architects and designers with unique architectural concepts. This project is an evolution of ideas discussed with Marcelo Ertorteguy and builds upon his initial experiments showcased on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18095341258140679/).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Your Prompt

Visit the [Architectural Prompt Generator](https://luigipacheco.github.io/architectural-prompt-generator/) to create a unique architectural prompt. The tool randomizes various architectural elements to spark creativity.

### Step 2: Bring Your Prompt to Life

After generating your prompt, head over to the [ArchPrompter ChatGPT Bot](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-N94mbptL7-archprompter). Here, paste your generated prompt to visualize the concept. The bot will create an image representation of your prompt, providing a visual aid for your architectural idea.

### Step 3: Further Exploration

The generated image and prompt can serve as a starting point for further exploration. Feel free to use other image generation tools to expand on the concept or to start drafting your architectural designs.

### Step 4: Share Your Creations

We love to see the amazing ideas and designs our tool helps to create. If you're on Instagram and want to share your creations with the community, tag [@codedvoxels](https://www.instagram.com/codedvoxels/). Let's inspire each other with our architectural visions!
